# Own-implementation-of-some-C-language-functions.
This repository stores some functions of C language which I tried to implement on my own during my training process.

Function descriptions you can find below:

## 1. SWAP (in progress)
* 0.0.1  A test version that demonstrates a fact when passing a parameter by value, a goal of the task is not achieved.
* 1.0.1. A simple method to swap values of two elements of one type (this version works with integers only).
* 1.0.2. New feature: Implemented the ability to enter values, which need to be swapped.
* 1.1.0. The program is divided into several files (one additional header and another .c file with definition of called function). CMake used as build automatisation tool.

## 2. STRLEN (complete)
* 1.0.1 The function returns the length of the string passed to it. One pointer is used.
* 1.0.2 Refactoring a previous version with two pointers usage.


## 3. toUPPER (in be done)
The task is to write a function that converts characters in a string to uppercase. The function returns a new string. The original line remains unchanged.
