# Own-implementation-of-some-C-language-functions.
This repository stores some functions of C language which I tried to implement on my own during my training process.

Function descriptions you can find below:

## 1. STRLEN (in progress)
* 1.0.1 The function returns the length of the string passed to it. One pointer is used.
* 1.0.2 Refactoring a previous version with two pointers usage.


## 2. toUPPER (to be done)
The task is to write a function that converts characters in a string to uppercase. The function returns a new string. The original line remains unchanged.
